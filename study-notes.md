# Study Notes

## ✅ Goals
- Deepen my understanding of how Hardhat works and its tooling ecosystem.
- Learn the full structure and lifecycle of smart contracts using Solidity.
- Practice full stack dApp development by integrating smart contracts with front-end frameworks like Next.js.

## 🔍 Observations
- The course is extensive, well-structured, and packed with real-world Web3 development practices.
- Although the repo is archived and not maintained anymore, it's still incredibly valuable as a reference and practical walkthrough.
- Cyfrin Updraft and tools like Foundry are recommended as newer alternatives, but Hardhat remains an excellent starting point.

## 🔗 Key Takeaways So Far
- Solidity basics, contract structure, variables, arrays, and functions.
- Interactions between frontend (HTML/JS) and smart contracts via Ethers.js.
- How to use Chainlink oracles (VRF, Keepers, Price Feeds) in dApps.
- Understanding testnets (Sepolia, Goerli) and how to use faucets.
- Deployment and testing of contracts with Hardhat and VSCode.

## 💡 Next Steps
- Finish lessons on NFT Marketplace and DAO building (lessons 14–17).
- Fork additional modules and experiment with modifying contracts.
- Start building my own smart contract from scratch as a side project.
